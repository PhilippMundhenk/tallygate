  bearer-token management API on an internal network.

  setup wizard, web consoles via ttyd), scrypt password login, CSRF/origin protection, CSP;
  Telegram (inline buttons) and Matrix (reactions/replies) approval bots.
- **agent**: minimal Debian image with Claude Code, GitHub CLI (signed apt repo), checksum-verified
  ttyd; Remote Control supervised in tmux; placeholder credentials; status/self-test endpoint.
